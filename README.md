# How to use 8 Ball Script
Create a New File with the ending of .8ballbin and open it in your text editor of choice. This Language is a Binary Compiler, which means you need to know how to write Binary to use it. When you are done writing, drag and drop your .8ballbin file onto the .exe file. This will create a new file, "8ball_script.bin", which is the binary end result.

**Syntax:**

8 Ball Script is pretty simple, like in binary there are just ones and zeros, but instead its `:8ball:` for 0 and `:8ball::8ball:` for 1. Its seperated by `,` between 0 or 1 and `;` for the next sequence.

**Example:**

Hi:

:8ball:,:8ball::8ball:,:8ball:,:8ball:,:8ball::8ball:,:8ball:,:8ball:,:8ball:;:8ball:,:8ball::8ball:,:8ball::8ball:,:8ball:,:8ball::8ball:,:8ball:,:8ball:,:8ball::8ball:
```
:8ball:,:8ball::8ball:,:8ball:,:8ball:,:8ball::8ball:,:8ball:,:8ball:,:8ball:;:8ball:,:8ball::8ball:,:8ball::8ball:,:8ball:,:8ball::8ball:,:8ball:,:8ball:,:8ball::8ball:
```
<sub>This is a basic "Hi" sequence.</sub>

As you Probably noticed, this is not very efficient...
